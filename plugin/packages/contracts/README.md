# @owndsh/contracts

Generated and runtime contracts for the enterprise Harness packages. The
logical wire source is rooted at `../../../contracts/enterprise-openapi.yaml`
and includes its checked-in `components/` references.
`src/generated/` and `../../../contracts/generated/` are replaced together by
the generator and must not be edited manually. The protocol SHA-256 covers the
Swagger Parser bundle, so changing a referenced component cannot evade drift.

The public package exposes strict Zod schemas, stable HTTP error decoding, and
validated branded IDs. The generator maps `additionalProperties: false` to
Zod `.strict()` so unknown wire fields fail instead of being stripped. Raw
generated ID aliases are deliberately not exported: business packages must
construct IDs through the matching `parse*Id()` helper.

The public surface also exports the T08 provider, managed-model, and grant DTOs,
the T09 bootstrap quota, policy/window, active-device usage, and prompt-free
ledger DTOs, the T10/T11 gateway request with its validated reasoning pair, and
the T16 format-v0 Session batch/list/export/tombstone DTOs and strict schemas.
Provider credentials remain write-only; provider routes and credentials are
intentionally absent from every client-controlled gateway field and runtime
response type.

The package inherits the workspace strict TypeScript baseline but disables
`exactOptionalPropertyTypes` locally because Hey API 0.99.0's generated Fetch
runtime passes explicit `undefined` for optional Web API fields. This exception
does not weaken the OpenAPI/Zod runtime boundary or any sibling package.
